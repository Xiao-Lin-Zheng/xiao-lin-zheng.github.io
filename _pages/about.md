Hey! I'm Xiao Lin, originally from Guangdong, China, and now based in Brooklyn, New York. I’m majoring in Computer Science at Syracuse University, where I’m a proud McNair, Kessler Scholar, member of WiSE-CPP, and Director of International Student Affairs in Student Association. Beyond academics, I love dancing, crocheting, cooking, and baking. I’ve interned at Hyve Group, worked as a research assistant at the University of Michigan’s SLED lab, and I’m currently part of the SHAN Research Group at Syracuse University. Thanks for stopping by!
